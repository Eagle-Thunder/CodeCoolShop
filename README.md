# CodeCoolShop
A basic online shop simulation written in C# using ASP.NET and Razor

# The WHY
We developed this as an exercise, me and my team, when we needed to learn ASP.NET

# The WHAT
This here project simulates a simple online shop. A place where people can buy things posted by the site admins.

# The HOW
The project uses an ASP.NET server backed by an MSSQL database accessed via the ASP.NET Entity framework.
It simulates the entire user experience - from browsing products, autentication, owning a shopping cart to processing of payment.
For its intended purpose as a learning tool, we are pleased with the results of this little simulation.

# The WHO
This project is the work of a team of three - myself, as well as Sergiu Pert and Aleca Dumitru, and was devepoled over 10 days.
